- The VN-Index experienced unpredictable developments, sliding after initial gains. Foreign investors maintained net selling momentum. Experts advise caution due to uncertainty surrounding US tariff decisions, suggesting investors reduce leverage and prioritize risk management. Internal factors like expansionary monetary and fiscal policies could drive market growth in the second half of 2025, with the State Bank pursuing a flexible monetary policy and promoting public investment. The market is also supported by attractive valuations and the prospect of an upgrade.

- Vietnam's stock market faced a turbulent week due to heavy selling pressure, rising exchange rate pressures, high interbank interest rates, and persistent net selling by foreign investors. The VN-Index lost a significant support level, raising concerns about short-term prospects. Experts noted the VN-Index remains in a short-term downtrend below the 1,250-point resistance. They attributed selling pressure to foreign outflows, stop-loss activity, and margin reduction. Despite challenges, the market's capitalization remains attractive relative to GDP, and investors are advised to prioritize portfolio risk management.

- Capital flows in the Vietnamese stock market are gaining internal strength due to positive policy changes, despite prolonged foreign sell-offs. The stock market is supported by positive domestic factors, particularly the continued expansionary monetary policy in 2025. Experts forecast capital inflows will face mixed influences this year, constrained by expectations of the US Federal Reserve’s slow rate-cutting pace and exchange rate pressures. Optimism remains about the potential return of foreign investors, driven by the country’s anticipated upgrade to emerging market status by FTSE Russell.
