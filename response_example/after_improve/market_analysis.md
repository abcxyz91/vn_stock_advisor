- Tóm tắt: Vietnam’s stock market is showing strong momentum heading into the second half of 2025, buoyed by economic growth, policy support, and potential reclassification, but key risks remain. Nguyen Minh Hanh from SHS Securities highlighted the influence of international trade negotiations and tariff policies on the market. Market liquidity is expected to rotate, focusing on sectors less affected by tariffs like real estate, construction, financial services, and utilities. SHS maintains its year-end VN-Index target range at 1,400-1,420 points. Key drivers include potential tariff suspensions, sustained economic growth, Resolution 68-NQ/TW on private sector development, and the smooth operation of the KRX trading system, along with the outlook for an upgrade of Vietnam’s stock market classification.
